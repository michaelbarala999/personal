// Given two arrays: arr1[0..m-1] and arr2[0..n-1]. Find whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not. Both arrays are not in sorted order. It may be assumed that elements in both arrays are distinct.

// Examples: 

// Input: arr1[] = {11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7}, arr2[] = {11, 3, 7, 1} 
// Output: arr2[] is a subset of arr1[]

// Input: arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, arr2[] = {1, 2, 4} 
// Output: arr2[] is a subset of arr1[]
